# Unity Multiplayer Tank Mayhem

WARNING: This game was made when I first started out, the code is messy and has a lot of bloat. I don't have time to refactor it but I'm adding it here anyway in-case someone is interested in looking at it.

Contains all the code for Tank Mayhem, a multiplayer game made in a week in Unity

Doesn't actually contains the project files.

To play, you need to head over to releases and download the build there. To test it, start two instances of the application
play with yourself, alternatively, get a friend to play with you over the internet.
